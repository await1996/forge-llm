# forge-llm
It is a ground-up implementation of Large Language Models, inspired by the "LLMs-from-scratch" philosophy.
In a world of high-level frameworks, we go back to the basics. This project is an exercise in understanding — where we forge tensors, craft attention mechanisms, and hammer out gradient updates manually.
No magic, no black boxes. Just raw code, linear algebra, and the relentless pursuit of how generative AI truly works. Welcome to the forge.
